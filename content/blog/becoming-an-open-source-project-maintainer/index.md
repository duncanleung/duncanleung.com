I have a lot of open source projects that I maintain. I have personally
published over 100 packages to npm. Not all of them are widely used (or used at
all), but many of them are. I have some ideas about how to maintain open source
projects. I've given a talk on this in the past (unfortunately each time the
recording sadly failed, but there's a practice run, so
[check it out here](/talks/#managing-an-open-source-project)).

In this newsletter though, I want to talk about how you become a project
maintainer. The easiest way to do this is to create your own project from
scratch, but often what's more needed than a new project is to improve an
existing project. So how do you get involved?

![good question](./images/0.gif)

Well,
["You contribute best to something you use regularly."](/blog/what-open-source-project-should-i-contribute-to)
So before you decide you want to be a maintainer of a project, make sure it's
one that you use yourself, otherwise you'll lose motivation pretty quickly.

The first project I maintained that became widely used was
[`angular-formly`](https://github.com/formly-js/angular-formly). Several years
ago, I needed a library to make creating forms easier with angular. I tried a
few projects and finally landed with `angular-formly` as the one I liked the
most. As what often happens with open source projects, it didn't quite meet my
use cases. So I
[filed an issue](https://github.com/formly-js/angular-formly/issues/16) and
[made a pull request](https://github.com/formly-js/angular-formly/pull/17). It
was great.

Then something else came up and I
[made a pull request](https://github.com/formly-js/angular-formly/pull/19) for
that too. Then I started
[helping](https://github.com/formly-js/angular-formly/issues/21)
[in](https://github.com/formly-js/angular-formly/issues/23)
[issues](https://github.com/formly-js/angular-formly/issues/32) and
[reviewing](https://github.com/formly-js/angular-formly/pull/26)
[pull](https://github.com/formly-js/angular-formly/pull/54)
[requests](https://github.com/formly-js/angular-formly/pull/61). Then one day,
all of a sudden, the maintainer asked me if I wanted commit and publish access.
I was surprised and thrilled. It made so much sense though. I was doing more for
the project than he was at the time, so the transition worked well.

So here's the key takeaway:

![Are you ready for this?](./images/1.gif)

**_To become a project maintainer, act like a project maintainer._**

That means help with issues, make pull requests, help with documentation, answer
questions, make tutorials, review pull requests, etc. etc. etc. There's really
no need to get permission for doing those things. Just start doing it as much as
you're willing and able and magic things happen.

Now, I can't promise that you'll become a core maintainer of React if you start
helping in issues and pull requests. But I can tell you that a lot of
[the benefits of open source](/blog/how-getting-into-open-source-has-been-awesome-for-me)
will come even if you aren't the project maintainer. And many projects really do
need new maintainers (`angular-formly` included). You don't need permission to
start acting like a maintainer. If you start doing the work, then it's pretty
likely that the project maintainers will eventually give you decision making
power and you'll be able to make an impact on the project direction.

I should note also that not all maintainers are the same. Some really don't want
to reliquish control over the project. If you have an issue with the way the
project is maintained and they're not willing to let you help in the way you
want, you can definitely fork the project (famous example of this is
[`lodash`](https://lodash.com)).

What I love about open source is that you don't need anyone's permission to do
good work. So long as you're following the project code of conduct and respect
the project maintainers, your help will likely be very welcome. And if that
doesn't workout, your [BATNA](http://www.beyondintractability.org/essay/batna)
is to fork the project (learn about and be aware of the project license if you
ever do this).

I hope this is helpful! I personally have many projects that could use more
active project maintainers. And I've transitioned some of them to others in the
past as well. So feel free to start helping out on the projects you're using.
You never know. Good luck!
