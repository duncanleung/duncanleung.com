On [October 29th, 2015](http://babeljs.io/blog/2015/10/29/6.0.0),
[Sebastian McKenzie](https://twitter.com/sebmck),
[James Kyle](https://medium.com/@thejameskyle), and the rest of the Babel team
dropped a huge major release for frontend developers everywhere: Babel 6.0.0.
It's totally awesome. No longer just a transpiler, it's now a super pluggable
JavaScript tooling platform. As a community, we've only scratched the surface of
what it is capable of and I'm excited (and cautiously optimistic) for what the
future holds in JavaScript tooling.

All of that said, Babel 6.0.0 was an enormous breaking change. It had a bit of a
rocky start. It's not entirely straightforward to upgrade and takes some
learning. This post isn't going to talk about how you upgrade Babel,
necessarily. I'm just going to touch on what I learned about my own code when
Babel fixed a bug I relied on heavily... Here are some resources I recommend you
check out before you try to upgrade your stuff from Babel 5 to Babel 6:

## ES6 Modules

Upgrading for me would not have been that difficult if I had understood the ES6
Modules specification correctly. Babel 5 allowed misuse of _export_ and _import_
statements and Babel 6 fixed this problem. At first I thought this may be a bug.
I asked about it on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/q/33505992/971592)
and [Logan Smyth](https://twitter.com/loganfsmyth) informed me that I
fundamentally misunderstood ES6 modules and that Babel 5 had facilitated that
misunderstanding (writing a transpiler is hard).

## Near-midlife crisis

At first, I didn't quite understand what Logan meant, but when I had the time to
dedicate to upgrading my app,
[this happened](https://twitter.com/kentcdodds/status/671817302430515200)

[Tyler McGinnis](https://twitter.com/tylermcginnis),
[Josh Manders](https://twitter.com/joshmanders), and I went back and forth quite
a bit on this thread. It's probably hard to follow, but this is when I realized
that the problem wasn't exporting the object as a default, but how I expected
that I could import the object.

I always assumed that I could export an object as the default and then
destructure the pieces out of that object I needed, like so:

```js
// foo.js
const foo = {baz: 42, bar: false}
export default foo

// bar.js
import {baz} from './foo'
```

Babel 5 allowed this because of how it transpiled the export default statement.
However this is technically incorrect according to the spec which is why Babel 6
(correctly) removed that capability and effectively broke over 200 of my modules
in my application at work.

I finally figured out how things really work when I reviewed
[NicolÃ¡s Bevacqua's](https://twitter.com/nzgb)
[blogpost](https://ponyfoo.com/articles/es6)

https://twitter.com/kentcdodds/status/671831027787038721

And I discovered why what I had been doing wouldn't work when I read
[Axel Rauschmayer](https://twitter.com/rauschma)'s
[blogpost](http://www.2ality.com/2014/09/es6-modules-final.html)

https://twitter.com/kentcdodds/status/671830544129265664

Here's the basic idea: ES6 modules are supposed to be statically analyzable
(runtime cannot change the exports/imports) so it can't be dynamic. In the
example above, I could change the _foo_ object's properties at runtime and then
my _import_ statement could import that dynamic property, like this:

```js
// foo.js
const foo = {}
export default foo
somethingAsync().then(result => foo\[result.key\] = result.value)

// bar.js
import {foobar} from './foo'
```

We'll assume that _result.key_ is 'foobar'. In CommonJS this would work just
fine because the require statements happen at runtime (when they're required):

```js
// foo.js
const foo = {}
module.exports = foo
somethingAsync().then(result => foo\[result.key\] = result.value)

// bar.js
const {foobar} = require('./foo')
```

> However, because the ES6 specification states that imports and exports must be
> statically analyzable, you can't accomplish this dynamic behavior inÂ ES6.

So that's the _why_ for Babel's change. It's no longer possible to do this and
that's a good thing.

## What does thisÂ mean?

_Coming up with a good way to describe this in prose has proven difficult, so I
hope a bunch of code examples and comparisons will be instructive_

The problem I had was I was combining ES6 _exports_ with CommonJS _require_. I
would do something like this:

```js
// add.js
export default (x, y) => x + y

// bar.js
const three = require('./add')(1, 2)
```

With the changes that Babel made, I had three choices:

**Option 1:** require with default

```js
// add.js
export default (x, y) => x + y

// bar.js
const three = require('./add').default(1, 2)
```

**Option 2:** ES6 modules 100%

```js
// add.js
export default (x, y) => x + y

// bar.js
import add from './add'
const three = add(1, 2)
```

**Option 3:** CommonJS 100%

```js
// add.js
module.exports = (x, y) => x + y

// bar.js
const three = require('./add')(1, 2)
```

## How did I fixÂ it?

After a few hours I got the build running and the tests passing. I had two
different approaches for different scenarios:

1.  I changed the export to be CommonJS (_module.exports_) rather than ES6
    (_export default_) so I could continue to require it as I have been doing.
2.  I did a fancy regex find and replace (should have used a codemod) to change
    the other require statements from _require('./thing')_ to
    _require('./thing').default_

This worked out pretty well. The biggest challenge was just understanding how
the ES6 modules spec works and how Babel transpiles it down to CommonJS so it
can interoperate. Once I figured that out it was just monkey work to update my
code to follow this convention.

## Recommendations

Try to avoid mixing ES6 modules and CommonJS. I personally would say just go
with ES6 modules for everything. One of the reasons that I mixed them in the
first place was so I could do a one-liner require and immediately use the
required module (like _require('./add')(1, 2)_). But that's really not a big
enough benefit IMO.

If you feel like you must combine them, you might consider using one of the
following babel plugins/presets:

[**babel-preset-es2015-node5**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-preset-es2015-node5)

[**babel-plugin-add-module-exports**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-add-module-exports)

## Conclusion

The real lesson from all of this is that we should learn how things are supposed
to work. I could have saved myself a great deal of time if I had just understood
how the ES6 module spec actually is intended to work.

from Babel 5 to Babel 6:

## Appendixâ€¦

**More examples:**

Before the change with Babel, a require statement was similar to:

```javascript
import add from './add'
const three = add(1, 2)
```

But after the change in Babel, the require statement now becomes more like:

```javascript
import * as add from './add'
const three = add.default(1, 2)
```

What caused the problem for me was that now the add variable is no longer the
default export, but an object that has all the named exports and the default
export (under the default key).

**Named Exports:**

Itâ€™s notable that you can also use named exports and I recommend this with
utility modules. This will allow you to do the destructuring-like syntax in the
import statement (**warning, despite what it looks like itâ€™s not actually
destructing due to the static analysis reasons mentioned earlier**). So you
could do:

```javascript
// math.js
const add = (x, y) => x + y
const subtract = (x, y) => x - y
const multiply = (x, y) => x \* y
export {add, subtract, multiply}

// foo.js
import {subtract, multiply} from './math'
```

This gets really awesome/exciting with
[tree shaking](http://www.2ality.com/2015/12/webpack-tree-shaking.html).

Personally, I generally recommend that for a component (like a React component
or an Angular service) youâ€™ll want to use default exports (youâ€™re importing a
specific thing, single file, single component, you know ðŸ˜€). But for utility
modules you generally have various pure functions that can be used
independently. This is a great use case for named exports.
