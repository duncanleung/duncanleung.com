👋 Hi! I’m Duncan Leung.

I'm a Lead Front End Web Engineer and former product manager. I write about JavaScript, React, (a little bit of Go) and web development.

I'm a self taught software developer 👨🏻‍💻, and this is a
place for me to 📝 jot down some notes.

I currently lead the Frontend Web Team and QA Team at Airvet, and we provide <a href="https://www.airvet.com/" target="_blank">veterinary telemedicine access to pet owners</a>.
