[JSON](http://www.json.org/) is used to transmit data between a server and a browser. Here is a basic example of what might be in a `.json` string.

```js
{
  "name": "Tania",
  "title": "Web Developer",
  "website": ""
}
```

As you can see, it's a human readable format of data that might traditionally be stored in a table. Some companies might have public `.json` files located that you can access and extract data from (an API you can connect to). You might also save a `.json` file somewhere in your project that you want to extract data from.

#### Goals

JSON data can be accessed and utilized with many programming languages. In this tutorial, we'll learn how to access JSON with PHP and JavaScript.

#### Prerequisites

- You must either have [a local server](/local-environment/) set up, or a host that runs PHP and some basic PHP knowledge.
- Basic [knowledge of programming concepts](/javascript-day-one/) (arrays and variables) and using JavaScript.

## What is JSON?

JSON stands for **J**ava**S**cript **O**bject **N**otation. It is data saved in a `.json` file, and consists of a series of **key/value pairs**.

```js
{ "key": "value" }
```

The **value** of any JSON key can be a string, Boolean, number, null, array, or object. Comments are not allowed in JSON.

Although JSON resembles an object or an array, **JSON is a string**. A serialized string, which means it can later be parsed and decoded into data types.

## Using data from JSON with PHP

First, to drill in that JSON is simply a string, we're going to write JSON into a PHP string and apply it to a variable called `$data`.

```php
$data = '{
	"name": "Aragorn",
	"race": "Human"
}';
```

Then we'll use the `json_decode()` function to convert the JSON string into a PHP object.

```php
$character = json_decode($data);
```

Now we can access it as a PHP object.

```php
echo $character->name;
```

Here's the whole file.

```php
<?php

$data = '{
	"name": "Aragorn",
	"race": "Human"
}';

$character = json_decode($data);
echo $character->name;
```

Here is the output.

```terminal
Aragorn
```

### Accessing a JSON feed from a URL

From here out, we'll put all JSON data into its own `.json` file. This way, we can retrieve the contents of the file instead of keeping it as a PHP string.

Here's what **data.json** will look like.

```js
[{
	"name": "Aragorn",
	"race": "Human"
}, {
	"name": "Legolas",
	"race": "Elf"
}, {
	"name": "Gimli",
	"race": "Dwarf"
}]
```

And here's how we'll extract that data in PHP.

```php
$url = 'data.json'; // path to your JSON file
$data = file_get_contents($url); // put the contents of the file into a variable
$characters = json_decode($data); // decode the JSON feed
```

In order to get one entry, we'll have to access the appropriate array number. Remember, counting begins with 0 in programming.

```php
echo $characters[0]->name;
```

```terminal
Aragorn
```

I can access all the data in the array with a `foreach` loop.

```php
foreach ($characters as $character) {
	echo $character->name . '<br>';
}
```

```terminal
Aragorn
Legolas
Gimli
```

Here is the full PHP file.

```php
<?php

$url = 'data.json'; // path to your JSON file
$data = file_get_contents($url); // put the contents of the file into a variable
$characters = json_decode($data); // decode the JSON feed

echo $characters[0]->name;

foreach ($characters as $character) {
	echo $character->name . '<br>';
}
```

We can display the data in a table, for an example.

```php
<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<th>Name</th>
			<th>Race</th>
		</tr>
		<?php foreach ($characters as $character) : ?>
        <tr>
            <td> <?php echo $character->name; ?> </td>
            <td> <?php echo $character->race; ?> </td>
        </tr>
		<?php endforeach; ?>
	</tbody>
</table>
```

|         |       |
| ------- | ----- |
| Aragorn | Human |
| Gimli   | Dwarf |
| Legolas | Elf   |

> In this example, I'm using the alternate syntax for `foreach`, which looks like `foreach() : /* loop */ endforeach;` instead of `foreach() { /* loop */ }`. This is often preferable when outputting HTML.

### Using associative arrays

There's another way we can access the data in PHP. If you pass `true` as the argument in `json_decode()`, the data becomes an associative array instead of an object. This means we'll be using square bracket notation`[]` instead of the skinny arrow`->`.

```php
$characters = json_decode($data, true); // decode the JSON feed and make an associative array
```

Instead of `->race`, we will access the value with `['race']`.

```php
echo $characters[0]['race'];
```

```terminal
Human
```

And here's how to access the loop.

```php
foreach ($characters as $character) {
	echo $character['race'] . "\n";
}
```

```terminal
Human
Elf
Dwarf
```

### Getting data from nested arrays

So far, we've only used JSON feeds with key/value pairs, but it's common to encounter nesting. Here's another nerdy example, which we can save in a new file called **wizards.json**.

```php
[
	{
		"name": "Harry Potter",
		"wand": [
			{
"core": "phoenix feather",
"length": "11 inches",
"wood": "holly"
			}
		]
	},
	{
		"name": "Hermione Granger",
		"wand": [
			{
"core": "dragon heartstring",
"length": "10 and 3/4 inches",
"wood": "vine"
			}
		]
	}
]
```

Decoding the feed.

```php
$url = 'wizards.json';
$data = file_get_contents($url);
$wizards = json_decode($data, true);
```

We'll be able to access the nested array using `$wizard['key'][0]['key']` in a loop, or whatever number corresponds correctly if you only want to print one.

```php
foreach ($wizards as $wizard) {
	echo $wizard['name'] . '\'s wand is ' .
	$wizard['wand'][0]['wood'] . ', ' .
	$wizard['wand'][0]['length'] . ', with a ' .
	$wizard['wand'][0]['core'] . ' core. <br>' ;
}
```

```terminal
Harry Potter's wand is holly, 11 inches, with a phoenix feather core.
    Hermione Granger's wand is vine, 10 and 3/4 inches, with a dragon heartstring core.
```

### Converting a PHP object or array into JSON

Just as you use `json_decode()` to turn JSON into PHP, you can turn PHP into JSON with `json_encode()`.

```php
$data = [
	'name' => 'Aragorn',
	'race' => 'Human'
];

echo json_encode($data);
```

We made a PHP array and encoded it. Here's the output:

```terminal
{"name":"Aragorn","race":"Human"}
```

## Using data from JSON with JavaScript

We're going to create a JavaScript variable called `data` and apply the JSON string.

```js
var data = '[ { "name": "Aragorn", "race": "Human" }, { "name": "Gimli", "race": "Dwarf" } ]'
```

Now we'll use JavaScript built in `JSON.parse()` function to decode the string.

```php
data = JSON.parse(data);
```

From here we can access the data like a regular JavaScript object.

```js
console.log(data[1].name)
```

```terminal
Gimli
```

And we can loop through each iteration with a `for` loop.

```js
for (var i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {
  console.log(data[i].name + ' is a ' + data[i].race + '.')
}
```

```terminal
Aragorn is a Human.
    Gimli is a Dwarf.

```

That was easy! Now, we'll probably need to access JSON from a URL. There's an extra step involved, where we have to make a request to the file. Let's just take the above JSON string and put it in **data.json**.

```js
;[
  {
    name: 'Aragorn',
    race: 'Human',
  },
  {
    name: 'Gimli',
    race: 'Dwarf',
  },
]
```

Now we'll make an `XMLHttpRequest()`.

```js
var request = new XMLHttpRequest()
```

We'll open the file (**data.json**) via GET (URL) request.

```js
request.open('GET', 'data.json', true)
```

From here, we'll parse and work with all our JSON data within the `onload` function.

```js
request.onload = function() {
  // begin accessing JSON data here
}
```

Then finally, submit the request.

```js
request.send()
```

Here's the final code.

```js
var request = new XMLHttpRequest()

request.open('GET', 'data.json', true)

request.onload = function() {
  // begin accessing JSON data here
  var data = JSON.parse(this.response)

  for (var i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {
    console.log(data[i].name + ' is a ' + data[i].race + '.')
  }
}

request.send()
```

And the output.

```terminal
Aragorn is a Human.
Gimli is a Dwarf.
```

### Using Fetch

Now you can also use the Fetch API to do the same thing. Read [How to use the JavaScript Fetch API to Get JSON Data](/how-to-use-the-javascript-fetch-api-to-get-json-data/) for an easier method to get this data.

```js
// Replace ./data.json with your JSON feed
fetch('./data.json')
  .then(response => {
    return response.json()
  })
  .then(data => {
    // Work with JSON data here
    console.log(data)
  })
  .catch(err => {
    // Do something for an error here
  })
```

### Using jQuery

As you can see, it's not too difficult to retrieve a JSON feed with plain JavaScript. However, it's even easier with jQuery, using the `getJSON()` function. If you don't know how jQuery works, you'll need to load the [jQuery JavaScript library](https://jquery.com/) before any of this custom code.

```js
$(document).ready(function() {
  $.getJSON('data.json', function(data) {
    // begin accessing JSON data here
    console.log(data[0].name)
  })
})
```

You might also see jQuery access JSON via an AJAX request, which is a little more verbose.

```js
$(document).ready(function() {
  var data
  $.ajax({
    dataType: 'json',
    url: 'data.json',
    data: data,
    success: function(data) {
      // begin accessing JSON data here
      console.log(data[0].name)
    },
  })
})
```

Both will have the same output.

```terminal
Aragorn
```
