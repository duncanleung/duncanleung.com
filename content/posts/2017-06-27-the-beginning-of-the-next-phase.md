Today is a pretty big day for me - it's the last day of my first full-time web development job. I began my career change journey about three years ago, and I can't believe how much I've learned, and how many awesome people I've connected with through this industry already. I had no idea the blog I created for the purpose of documenting and keeping track of all the things I've learned would gain so much traction. So thank you all for reading, messaging, connecting, helping, donating, and encouraging. I appreciate all your words and actions so much! And if I don't know you yet, please [feel free to get in touch!](/contact)

I've decided to put more time into turning this website into a viable source of income. At the moment, I make a few donations that is almost enough to cover the cost of the server, but no where close enough to being able to support me. I plan to make effective and high-quality paid courses to bring in income, either as a side hustle before looking into another full-time job, or as a way of sustaining myself. Additionally, I'll be doing some freelancing and freelance writing. I have a small amount of current opportunities lined up, but if you have anything I should be aware of, please let me know!

Otherwise, I plan to do a bit of traveling - I just booked a one way flight to Europe, so we'll see how that goes! It will be my first solo trip out of the country that I won't be staying with someone I know.

## Articles in Progress

Here are a few articles I've been partially working on that I want to publish as soon as possible.

- My **career change story**, and the journey of getting my first web development job
- A list of bloggers and **web developers I follow** in 2017
- **Node and npm installations** for Mac and Windows
- Create a **Webpack setup to compile ES6** and Sass with hot reload on save
- My habits and methods for **being happy**
- Understanding **CSS positioning** with practical examples
- Working with the **DOM with plain JavaScript** (no jQuery)
- Empathy in the Web Development Industry
- Create a **PHP contact form**

I'll also be doing a lot of writing on JavaScript outside of this website.

## Course Idea

My idea for a **full course on web development** would be a complete introduction to HTML and CSS, teaching the necessary code to build a finished website with current era design and best practices.

Anything you would like to see a course on, please let me know in the comments.

I'm excited to begin this next step in my life's journey! No matter what happens, whether I succeed in this venture or fail, I know I'll learn valuable things about myself and continuously grow in the career I love.
