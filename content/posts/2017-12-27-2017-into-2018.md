Last year, I wrote [2016 into 2017](/2016-into-2017/), a post summarizing what I felt I accomplished throughout the year and some of my goals for the year to come. I'm continuing that tradition this year,

## I visited 13 countries

This was the big one. I realized a lifelong dream of mine to take an extended, solo travel adventure in foreign lands. I detailed the trip in this [Backpacking Europe](/europe/) post. It's hard to summarize in a sentence or two, but meeting three branches of my extended family and my European friends Craig, Timm, Rose, Esther, and João, as well as making a few new ones along the way.

I also went to New York, San Francisco, Nashville, and D.C., seeing more of my own country.

- Scotland (Edinburgh)
- Portugal (Braga, Porto, Lisbon)
- Spain (Seville, Malaga, Nerja)
- Germany (Berlin, Munich)
- Czechia (Prague, Slavkov U Brna)
- Austria (Vienna)
- Hungary (Budapest)
- Bulgaria (Sofia, Kazanlak)
- Greece (Athens)
- Slovakia (Bratislava, Klin)
- Switzerland (Zurich, Lucerne)
- England (London)
- Ireland (Dublin)

## I wrote 43 articles

This is huge! Last year I wrote 14 - this year, 43! I wrote for DigitalOcean and SitePoint as well as my own website. Writing tutorials is still my preferred method of learning, and I'm glad to be able to share it with you all.

## I did 1 presentation

This year I did a speech on creating a WordPress theme from scratch for [WordCamp 2017](https://2017.chicago.wordcamp.org/). This was my first presentation ever, and it was a great experience! I hope to do more talks as time goes on.

## I made 853 commits

This doesn't mean much, but the squares look cool, right? I'm missing a big chunk during my travel adventure.
