We hosted our first Hacktoberfest meetup at AutoGravity! A celebration of open source with food, drinks, and great company!

[Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) is here again and a colleague and I decided to gather together the Orange County tech community by hosting a meetup event at our new AutoGravity office!

We had a great turnout with the open source maintainers for [SendGrid](https://github.com/sendgrid/) ([Elmer Thomas](https://twitter.com/thinkingserious)), [Operation Code](https://github.com/OperationCode) ([Kyle Holmberg](https://twitter.com/kylemh_)), and [hummusRecipe](https://github.com/chunyenHuang/hummusRecipe) ([John Huang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnhuangguo/)) with us to chat with the community.

In the theme of supporting new developers, Kyle also ran a short workshop helping new developers submit their first pull request.

The rest of the night was an open session to allow developers to network, and work on pull requests together.
