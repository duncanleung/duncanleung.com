React Context API is a way to essentially create global variables that can be passed around in a React app. This is the alternative to "prop drilling", or passing props from grandparent to parent to child, and so on. Context is often touted as a simpler, lighter solution to using Redux for state management. I haven't used Redux myself yet, but every time I use React's Context API, I have to look it up because it doesn't seem obvious to me.

I'm going to leave some brief, concise steps to getting started with Context here.

## Prerequisite

- Read [Getting Started with React](https://www.taniarascia.com/getting-started-with-react/) or [Build a React App with Hooks](https://www.taniarascia.com/crud-app-in-react-with-hooks/) if you don't know React or React Hooks yet.

## Create Context

Imagine I have some information I want to be available anywhere or everywhere throughout a React app. A theme might be implemented using Context - for example, on this site I have Context serving three themes: dark mode, light mode, and MS-DOS mode (on the [404 page](/404)).In this simple example, I'll use a logged in user.

I'll create Context, and call it `UserContext`. This will also give me `UserContext.Provider` and `UserContext.Consumer`. What these two components do is straightforward:

- **Provider** - The component that provides the value
- **Consumer** - A component that is consuming the value

So I'll create it with `React.createContext()` in a new file called `UserContext.js`.

<div class="filename">src/UserContext.js</div>

```jsx
import React from 'react'

const UserContext = React.createContext({})

export const UserProvider = UserContext.Provider
export const UserConsumer = UserContext.Consumer
export default UserContext
```

I'm passing in an empty object value here to represent that I might be filling in this data later with an API call. You can pre-populate this with whatever data you want, in case you're not retrieving the data through an API.

```jsx
React.createContext(true)
```

## Providing Context

The provider always needs to exist as a wrapper around the parent element, no matter how you choose to consume the values. I'll wrap the entire `App` component in the `Provider`. I'm just creating some value (`user`) and passing it down as the `Provider` value prop.

<div class="filename">src/App.js</div>

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import HomePage from './HomePage'
import { UserProvider } from './UserContext'

function App() {
  const user = { name: 'Tania', loggedIn: true }

  return (
    <UserProvider value={user}>
      <HomePage />
    </UserProvider>
  )
}
```

Now any child, grandchild, great-grandchild, and so on will have access to `user` as a prop. Unfortunately, retrieving that value is slightly more involved than simply getting it like you might with `this.props` or `this.state`.

## Consuming Context

The way you provide Context is the same for class and functional components, but consuming it is a little different for both.

### Class component

The traditional way to retrieve Context values was by wrapping the child component in the `Consumer`. From there, you would be able to access the value prop as `props`.

<div class="filename">src/HomePage.js (class example)</div>

```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react'
import { UserConsumer } from './UserContext'

class HomePage extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <UserConsumer>
        {props => {
          return <div>{props.name}</div>
        }}
      </UserConsumer>
    )
  }
}
```

But what about lifecycle methods? What if I need the value from Context outside of `render`? The wrapper method was limited. Instead, we can do this in a class with `contextType`, which is a static variable on the class.

<div class="filename">src/HomePage.js (class example)</div>

```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react'
import UserContext from './UserContext'

class HomePage extends Component {
  static contextType = UserContext

  componentDidMount() {
    const user = this.context

    console.log(user) // { name: 'Tania', loggedIn: true }
  }

  render() {
    return null
  }
}
```

### Functional component and Hooks

For functional components, you'll use `useContext`, such as in the example below. This is the equivalent of `static contextType`.

<div class="filename">src/HomePage.js</div>

```jsx
import React, { useContext } from 'react'
import UserContext from './UserContext'

function HomePage() {
  const user = useContext(UserContext)

  console.log(user) // { name: 'Tania', loggedIn: true }

  return null
}
```

## Conclusion

So there you have it.

- Use `const xContext = React.createContext()` to create context.
- Pull `xContext.Provider` and `xContext.Consumer` out of `xContext`
- Wrap `Provider` around your parent component.
- A class can consume with `static contextType = xContext`
- A functional component can consume with `const x = useContext(xContext)`

Hope this helps! I know I'll be referring to this page again in the future.
