I recently discovered that I ended up on the Hacker Noon awards for [Personal Developer Blog of the Year 2019](https://hackernoon.com/personal-developer-blog-of-the-year-hacker-noon-noonies-awards-2019-hz2tu32ql), which is an amazing honor! I got third place. I thought that was pretty neat, so I figured I'd mention it. Thank you all for reading, subscribing, and sharing my content!

In 2017, [I wrote a list](/web-developers-and-bloggers-i-follow-2017/) of some bloggers I follow, though much of the list wasn't actually web development related. I have a few favorites blogs I keep an eye on right now, so I'll share them with you.

Everyone on this list has their own personal website/blog that isn't hosted on some third party like Medium, most of them have no ads, and I think they're all cool people in general.

## Robin Wieruch

- [robinwieruch.de](https://www.robinwieruch.de/)

Chances are, if you're looking for something about Firebase or React/Redux, you've probably ended up on Robin's blog. With good reason - he has tons of great tutorials.

## Khalil Stemmler

- [khalilstemmler.com](https://khalilstemmler.com/)

Khalil is filling an all-too-rare niche in web development blogs, which is how to build large scale applications properly, specifically with TypeScript and Node. He's bridging the gap between intermediate and advanced, which is a difficult area to cover. Check it out if you're looking for something beyond "Hello, World"!

## Flavio Copes

- [flaviocopes.com](https://flaviocopes.com/)

No one is more prolific than Flavio. I honestly don't know how he has time to breathe, much less write all these tutorials. Not only does he write a blog post _every single day_, but he has endless handbooks, courses, and tutorials. Some of the posts are more like snippets, but you'll find nice, succinct helpful stuff on there.

## Dan Abramov

- [overreacted.io](https://overreacted.io/)

If you're into JavaScript, and especially React, I'm sure you already know and love our React Overlord, Dan Abramov. Dan is known for his amazing contributions to JavaScript - Create React App and Redux - and his blog is known for long, insightful posts that cover unique areas of JavaScript and development in general. His [Things I Don't Know](https://overreacted.io/things-i-dont-know-as-of-2018/) and [Things I Know](https://overreacted.io/the-elements-of-ui-engineering/) have inspired many spinoff articles, including my [Everything I Know as a Software Developer Without a Degree](/everything-i-know-as-a-software-developer-without-a-degree/) post.

## Swyx

- [swyx.io](https://www.swyx.io/)

Swyx has a lot of great posts and tutorials, and one of his most famous contributions to the web development zeitgeist is [Learn in Public](https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public/). I was inspired by that post, as it's what I've been doing all along since I started developing, and what I recommend to everyone who wants to become a developer themselves. In response, I made [my own Learning in Public page](/learn).

## Chris Ferdinandi

- [gomakethings.com](https://gomakethings.com/)

Chris is _the_ vanilla JavaScript advocate. If you want to know how to do anything in vanilla JavaScript, you'll probably find it on his site. No frameworks - React, Vue, Angular, jQuery - just plain old JavaScript and the DOM. Particularly useful for those who only know jQuery.

## James King

- [upmostly.com](https://upmostly.com/)

Probably the cleanest, fastest site running on WordPress I've ever seen. James writes about React every week, and I always appreciate anyone who is consistent with their blogging. (Something I'm not very good at...)

## Ahmad Awais

- [ahmadawais.com](https://ahmadawais.com/)

I've recently discovered Ahmad, and he has an some extremely impressive credentials. If there's a list or committee in web development, he's probably on it or associated with it - Google Developer Expert, Node.js Committee Member, WordPress Core Developer, to name a few. He also made a popular code theme, [Shades of Purple](https://github.com/ahmadawais/shades-of-purple-vscode)...but I'll never switch from [New Moon](https://github.com/taniarascia/new-moon)!

## Valentino Gagliardi

- [valentinog.com](https://www.valentinog.com/blog/)

Another great site for tutorials. I've landed on Valentino's site plenty of times. His articles are very in-depth and informative, and he cares about responding to users and helping them out as well.

I'm sure I've forgotten a ton, but I wanted to get a little list out of the ones that came to my head.
