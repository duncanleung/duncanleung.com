### Get up to speed with JavaScript’s built-in APIs and syntax for asynchronous programming

One of JavaScript’s strengths is what’s called the “event loop.” This one
language architectural element forms a lot about how you program and interact
with JavaScript in your day-to-day. In recent years, JavaScript has made leaps
and bounds in the built-in standard library and syntax to allow for better
asynchronous patterns.

## Two commonly used patterns are:

<List>
  <Li check>
    The Promises API, which represents the eventual completion of an operation.
  </Li>
  <Li check>
    Async/await syntax, which pauses the execution of a function until that
    promise is settled.
  </Li>
</List>

Together, these two patterns allow you to create asynchronous code that is easy
to follow, readable, and behaves more or less like synchronous code.

Hi, I'm Kent C. Dodds and in my latest workshop, we’ll take a deep dive into
Promises and async/await to improve your asynchronous programming.

## When you're done you will:

<List>
  <Li check>write asynchronous functions with async/await</Li>
  <Li check>create promises to resolve JSON objects</Li>
  <Li check>see how these two patterns relate to one another</Li>
  <Li check>
    have a strong understanding of how async code works in JavaScript with these
    patterns
  </Li>
  <Li check>write more readable, easy-to-follow async code.</Li>
</List>

## Topics

- Understanding JavaScript’s Event Loop
- Callbacks
- Promises (very deep dive)
- Async/await

## Pre-requisites

- Attend my [Modern JavaScript Workshop](/workshops/modern-javascript) or have
  the equivalent experience with modern JavaScript APIs and Syntax.
