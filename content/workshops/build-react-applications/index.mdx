### Use common libraries to build ReactJS applications

The React and JavaScript ecosystem is full of tools and libraries to help you
build your applications. In this workshop we’ll build an application from
scratch using widely supported and used tools and techniques. We’ll cover
everything common to most frontend React applications like routing, code
splitting, data fetching, styling, authentication, and forms.

## Topics

- Bootstrap a new react application with create-react-app
- Support client-side routing with @reach/router
- Manage global application state with context
- Use React's Suspense feature for code-splitting
- Authentication
- Data management
- Manage forms and lists

## Pre-requisites

- Attend my [Advanced React Hooks Workshop](/workshops/advanced-react-hooks), or
  have the equivalent basic experience of using advanced hooks. You should be
  experienced with `useContext`, `useReducer`, `useMemo`, and `useCallback`.
