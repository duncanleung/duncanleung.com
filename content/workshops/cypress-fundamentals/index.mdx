### Use Cypress to write end-to-end tests and be confident that the whole app works together.

Cypress is an incredibly powerful web testing tool. It’s capable of testing any
web application. Its architecture places it a cut above similar end-to-end
testing tools. Its developer experience is best-in-class. And because Cypress
runs your tests in the same context as the rest of your application, you’re able
to get speed, reliability, and debuggability that are just a long-distant dream
with similar tools. The catch? There is no catch. Cypress is exceptional.

In this workshop, we’ll go over how you can install, configure, and script
Cypress to test modern, real-world JavaScript web applications.
