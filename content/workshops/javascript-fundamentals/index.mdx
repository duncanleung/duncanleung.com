### Take someone with no knowledge of computer programming and get them started with JavaScript

Interested in learning to program?

Do you want to build the next Facebook?

Or even just a little custom app to track (and reduce) your trips to the soda

JavaScript can get you there. It’s:

<List>

JavaScript. We will start out with common elements in JavaScript, build up to
variables and functions, and finally use Netlify to put your code on the web.

By the end of the workshop, you will:

    applications
  </Li>
