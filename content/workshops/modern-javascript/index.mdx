### Get up to speed on the latest, most useful JavaScript features to level up your programming

The ECMAScript standard is now on a yearly release cycle. The 9th edition,
released in 2018, features async iteration, promise.protoype.finally(),
rest/spread, and updates to RegExp, and those join a plethora of other powerful
features released in the last few years.

For experienced programmers, keeping up with these features makes you more
productive, your code more expressive and maintainable, and your projects better
in the long run.

JavaScript is always improving, and when you keep up with all the updates, you
can keep improving, too.
