### Learn the foundational concepts necessary for building React applications and libraries

Working effectively with React requires an understanding of JSX and React
elements. Many engineers work with React for months or years without ever having
a clear idea of how JSX works or what it even really is. They memorize a list of
rules and miss out on opportunities to make their code more expressive and
maintainable. Additionally, building applications in React requires an
understanding of code reuse through custom components, using and changing data
over time (state), handling user events, and working with forms.

In this workshop, you’ll learn everything you need to be effective with the
fundamental building block of React applications. When you’re finished, you’ll
be prepared to create React components to build excellent experiences for your
app's users.
