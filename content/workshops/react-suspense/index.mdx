### Simplify your Async UI and improve your User Experience

One of the biggest challenges to writing software for the web is dealing with
asynchrony, but we have to deal with it all the time.

This leads to a bunch of boilerplate code for handling loading and error states
just to get the data we need to show the user-- whether the data comes from a
remote endpoint or from browser APIs like geolocation and Bluetooth.

The end result is countless spinners and the dreaded FOLC (flash of loading
content).

React Suspense is the answer to these problems.

React Suspense is a primitive built-into React that drastically simplifies
asynchronous state management in our applications, and helps you avoid FOLC out
of the box.

It's a bit of a different approach to managing these problems and understanding
how it works is key to taking advantage of what it has to offer.

In this workshop, you'll learn how Suspense works under the hood, preparing you
for the future of asynchronous state management.

  <Li check>understand the benefits and how to of "render as you fetch"</Li>
  <Li check>
    know how to use <code>useTransition</code> and <code>useDeferredValue</code>{' '}
    effectively
  </Li>
  <Li check>
    know how to write your own cache for suspense-based abstractions

## Pre-requisites

- [ ] Watch Dan Abramov's talk
      [Beyond React 16 | JSConf Iceland 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLF0n9SACd4)
      (33 minutes)
- [ ] Go through my
      [Learn React Hooks Workshop](https://kentcdodds.com/workshops/hooks), or
      have the equivalent basic experience of using hooks. You should be
      experienced with `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useRef`.
- [ ] Go through my
      [Advanced React Hooks Workshop](https://kentcdodds.com/workshops/advanced-react-hooks),
      or have the equivalent experience. You should be experienced with
      `useContext` and `useReducer` (experience with `useMemo` and `useCallback`
      is a bonus).
