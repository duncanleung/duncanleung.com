### Use jest, jest-dom, and React Testing Library to write unit and integration tests for React Components

Writing React applications is pretty easy, but shipping those applications with
confidence is an entirely different story. How do you know that your changes
work? How do you know those changes aren’t going to break other parts of your
application? Do you have to manually walk through your whole application to make
certain everything’s still working? No thank you! The more your tests resemble
the way your software is used, the more confidence they can give you. Let’s
learn how to write tests that make us confident.

In this hands-on workshop we’ll work on adding tests to existing components as
well as use our tests to speed up our workflow building new components. We’ll
work with everything from simple components and JavaScript functions to complex
components with asynchronous logic.

## Topics

- Install jest-dom and React Testing Library and configure them to work well
  with Jest
- Test a simple component
- Test function logic with jest-in-case
- Test components that make HTTP requests
- Test a form
- Test driven development
- Write a custom render function for testing components that rely on context
  providers (like @reach/router and redux)

## Pre-requisites

- Attend my [React Fundamentals Workshop](/workshops/react-fundamentals) or have
  the equivalent fundamental experience with React and JavaScript.
- Attend my [Testing Fundamentals Workshop](/workshops/testing-fundamentals) or
  have the equivalent experience with the fundamentals of testing.
