### Get a solid understanding of automated testing

Do you know what a testing framework does? Do you know what makes a testing
framework different from a testing or assertion library? Do you know how and
when to create mock versions of JavaScript modules? The best way to use a tool
effectively is to understand how it works. And the best way to understand how a
tool works is by making it yourself!

In this workshop, we’ll learn how testing frameworks, assertion libraries, and
mocking libraries work by building our own, simple version of each.

## Topics

- Make the simplest form of a test module and run it with node without any
  libraries
- Simplify our test with our own assertion library
- Isolate tests with our own testing framework
- Support async tests
- Why and when should you mock JavaScript modules and functions?
- Use monkey-patch mocking
- Make assertions to ensure you’re calling the mocked functions correctly
- Mock an entire module

## Pre-requisites

- Attend my
  [JavaScript Fundamentals Workshop](/workshops/javascript-fundamentals) or have
  equivalent experience with JavaScript fundamentals.
