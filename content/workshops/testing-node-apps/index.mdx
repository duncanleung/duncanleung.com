description:
  In this workshop, we'll cover common cases you'll come across when testing a
  production Node.js application which uses frameworks like Express.js, Nest.js,
  Koa.js, Hapi.js and more. By the end of this, you'll know what you need to do
  to increase your deployment confidence by adding unit and integration tests
  your Node.js-based backends.

### Increase your confidence in deploying Node.js-based backends

Backends hold so much of our application's business logic that is often used to
support multiple clients (web, mobile, and other native platforms). This logic
is critical to get right and deploying a breaking change to this can be
devastating to your company's goals (not to mention the bottom-line). Increasing
your "deployment confidence" is crucial and automated testing is the best way to
do that.

As Node.js continues to grow in usage around the world, learning how to test
this mission-critical code in a way that increases developer velocity as well as
confidence becomes increasingly important. In this workshop we use an Express.js
example and focus on the patterns and practices that you need to learn so you
can apply what you learn to test your code written in any Node.js web framework.
