# Hi, I'm Duncan!

I'm a JavaScript software engineer. I was born in 1986 and grew up in Singapore.
After graduating High School in Singapore, I went to
[UIUC](https://illinois.edu/) where I graduated with a Bachelor degree in
Industrial and Enterprise Systems Engineering.

I've written code for [iHerb](https://www.iherb.com),
[AutoGravity](https://autogravity.com), and participate in Open Source software.

**I now work for myself full-time as an educator.** I create content all about
Web Development on various platforms including:
[egghead.io](https://kcd.im/egghead), [Frontend Masters](https://kcd.im/fem),
[YouTube](https://kcd.im/youtube), [Twitter](https://kcd.im/twitter), and my own
sites like [TestingJavaScript.com](https://testingjavascript.com) 🏆

I live in Irvine, California with our two kids 👧👦.
